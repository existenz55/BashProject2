# BashProject2
Simple Bash Project

Students will develop a Bash Script program based on a given criteria.
Students will have to write the code up to good programming standards (correct
naming, indentation, comments in code), online submission + presentation to the lab tutors
in week 15 during the lab session.
Students are supposed to use parts of shell script programming learned in lab sessions, but they
are encouraged to use any new technologies that were not explicitly taught in lab sessions.
Final assessment will be done in lab session of week 15, students will be supposed to bring the
written script to the lab session (mail, OneDrive or memory stick), compile it during the
presentation, run the code to show itâ€™s functional and explain features of the code. Students
will be given exact timeslots during the session to be able to accommodate high volume of
students. No presence in a given time slot will result in fail mark.
To summarise, project will be marked based on the code functionality, criteria fulfilment
as well as code understanding in according to rubric given below.
